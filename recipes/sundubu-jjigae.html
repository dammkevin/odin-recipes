        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Sundubu-jjigae is a popular Korean stew known for its deep, spicy flavor and comforting warmth. The dish's main 
            ingredient is sundubu, which is soft, uncurdled tofu that adds a pleasingly mild and creamy contrast to the spicy 
            broth. The stew is typically made with a rich base of beef or seafood stock and includes a variety of additional 
            ingredients such as onions, zucchini, and mushrooms. Depending on the recipe, it might also contain seafood like 
            shrimp or clams, or meats such as pork or beef. A key component of the broth is gochugaru (Korean chili powder) or 
            gochujang (chili paste), which imparts a vivid red color and fiery heat to the dish. Other seasonings like garlic, 
            sesame oil, and soy sauce are added to enhance the umami and complexity of the flavors.

        <p>
            Traditionally served in a heated earthenware pot to keep the stew simmering throughout the meal, Sundubu-jjigae is 
            often accompanied by a raw egg that diners can crack into the pot just before eating. As the egg gently cooks in the 
            hot stew, it thickens the broth and adds a silky texture. This dish is not only cherished for its robust flavors but 
            also for its nutritional value, providing a hearty, protein-rich meal. Sundubu-jjigae is typically enjoyed with a bowl 
            of steamed rice and a selection of banchan (Korean side dishes) like kimchi, which complement the stew's spiciness and 
            round out the dining experience.

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>

        <li><h4>Prepare the Broth:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Make the Base Broth: In a pot, bring 2 cups of your chosen stock (anchovy, beef, or seafood) to a 
                boil. If you're starting from scratch, you can make a quick anchovy stock by boiling dried anchovies 
                and kelp in water for about 15 minutes, then strain.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Sauté the Ingredients:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sauté the Aromatics: In a separate pan or in a Korean stone pot (if you have one), heat a tablespoon 
                of sesame oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sliced onions, and sauté until they start to 
                soften and become fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add Protein: Add your choice of meat or seafood to the pan and cook until it starts to brown. If using 
                seafood like clams or shrimp, you might shorten the cooking time to avoid overcooking.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Assemble the Stew:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Combine Ingredients: Add the sliced zucchini, mushrooms, and any additional vegetables to the pot. Stir 
                in the gochugaru (chili powder) and gochujang (chili paste) if using, mixing well to coat the ingredients 
                evenly.</li>
            <li>Pour in Broth: Add the hot stock to the pot. Let the mixture come to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer 
                for about 5-10 minutes to let the flavors meld together.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Add the Tofu:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the Tofu: Carefully add the soft tofu in large chunks to the pot. You can break the tofu gently with a 
                spoon. Let the stew simmer for another 5-7 minutes so the tofu can absorb the flavors of the broth.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Final Touches:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Season the Stew: Adjust the seasoning with soy sauce, salt, and a teaspoon of sugar if needed. 
                The stew should have a balanced spicy and savory flavor.</li>
            <li>Add an Egg: Just before serving, crack an egg into the center of the stew. Cover the pot 
                for a minute or two to let the egg poach gently in the hot broth.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Serve:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Garnish and Serve: Garnish with chopped green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Serve 
                the stew piping hot directly in the pot (if possible) alongside a bowl of steamed rice.</li>
        </ul>

        </ol>
