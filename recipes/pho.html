        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Pho (pronounced "fuh") is a beloved Vietnamese noodle soup known for its aromatic broth, tender meats, and fresh herbs. 
            The clear, flavorful broth is traditionally made by simmering beef bones or chicken with charred onions, ginger, and a 
            blend of spices like star anise, cinnamon, and cloves. This soup features soft rice noodles (bánh phở) and is typically 
            served with thinly sliced beef, meatballs, or shredded chicken, though tofu can be used for a vegetarian version. 
            Fresh herbs such as cilantro, Thai basil, and mint, along with bean sprouts, lime wedges, and chili slices, are provided 
            as garnishes to customize each bowl.

            The preparation of pho starts with the broth, which is simmered for several hours to extract maximum flavor and ensure 
            clarity. Rice noodles are softened in hot water, and the meat is either cooked in the broth or added raw to be cooked by 
            the boiling hot broth when served. Pho is assembled in deep bowls with noodles and meat first, then topped with the hot 
            broth. Garnishes and condiments like hoisin sauce and sriracha are added to taste, creating a comforting yet complex dish 
            that offers a taste of Vietnamese culinary artistry.
