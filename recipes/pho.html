        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Pho (pronounced "fuh") is a beloved Vietnamese noodle soup known for its aromatic broth, tender meats, and fresh herbs. 
            The clear, flavorful broth is traditionally made by simmering beef bones or chicken with charred onions, ginger, and a 
            blend of spices like star anise, cinnamon, and cloves. This soup features soft rice noodles (bánh phở) and is typically 
            served with thinly sliced beef, meatballs, or shredded chicken, though tofu can be used for a vegetarian version. 
            Fresh herbs such as cilantro, Thai basil, and mint, along with bean sprouts, lime wedges, and chili slices, are provided 
            as garnishes to customize each bowl.

        <p>
            The preparation of pho starts with the broth, which is simmered for several hours to extract maximum flavor and ensure 
            clarity. Rice noodles are softened in hot water, and the meat is either cooked in the broth or added raw to be cooked by 
            the boiling hot broth when served. Pho is assembled in deep bowls with noodles and meat first, then topped with the hot 
            broth. Garnishes and condiments like hoisin sauce and sriracha are added to taste, creating a comforting yet complex dish 
            that offers a taste of Vietnamese culinary artistry.

            <li>4 quarts water</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Noodles and Meat:</h4>

            <li>1 pound rice noodles (bánh phở)</li>
            <li>1 pound beef (such as brisket, flank, or eye of round), thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Optional: beef meatballs, 1 pound chicken breast or thighs, cooked and shredded</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Garnishes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>Thai basil leaves</li>
            <li>Fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>Bean sprouts</li>
            <li>Lime wedges</li>
            <li>Fresh chili peppers, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>White onions, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Condiments:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>Sriracha sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>

        <li><h4>Char the Aromatics:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Char the onion and ginger either over an open flame or in a broiler until they're slightly blackened. This adds a 
            smoky flavor to the broth.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Toast the Spices:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a dry skillet, lightly toast the spices (star anise, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, coriander) until fragrant. 
            This helps release their flavors.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Prepare the Broth:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the beef bones in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and skim any scum that rises 
            to the surface.</li>
            <li>Add the charred onion and ginger along with the toasted spices to the pot. Reduce heat to low and simmer. 
            Partially cover the pot and simmer for at least 6 hours (the longer, the better), occasionally skimming the 
            fat or scum that floats to the top.</li>
            <li>Season the broth with fish sauce, salt, and a bit of sugar towards the end of cooking.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Prepare Rice Noodles:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Soak or cook the rice noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Assemble the Bowls:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Place a portion of the cooked rice noodles in each bowl.</li>
            <li>Arrange raw beef slices on top of the noodles. The heat from the broth will cook the thin slices of beef 
            when poured over them.</li>
            <li>If adding beef meatballs, pre-cook them (boil in water or broth until cooked through) and add them to the 
            bowl along with or instead of the raw beef slices.</li>
            <li>For chicken Pho, use cooked, shredded chicken breast or thigh meat instead of beef. Place the cooked chicken in the bowl 
            with the noodles.</li>
            <li>Strain the hot broth and pour it over the contents of the bowl. Make sure the broth is hot enough to cook the beef slices 
            or warm through the added meatballs or chicken.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Add Garnishes and Serve:</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve with plates of fresh basil, cilantro, lime wedges, bean sprouts, sliced green onions, and chili 
            peppers, allowing each person to garnish their Pho as they like.</li>
        </ul>

        </ol>
